# UnixCoD

UnixCod is a very old SSH Scanner/Auto SSH Brute force script.
You can't be brain dead and use it, you wont even understand so 
dont even take the time to figure it out if you have no fucking
clue what you're doing.

For running in 64bit machine, please running command bellow.

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386


sudo apt-get update



sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
